#summary This wiki will demonstrate the coding involved with setting up two different implementations of communication between a Flash unit and site hosted JavaScript.

= Introduction =

Using similar methods and logic, this project will focus on communication between a Flash file and site hosted JavaScript. This script will set or receive browser cookie values, which will be returned to Flash and/or JavaScript to determine the appropriate display state and/or HTML display settings via CSS attributes.

*Flash Billboard Unit with Branded Flash Based Close Button Solution*



*Flash Billboard Unit with Unbranded HTML Based Close Button Solution*

This solution will only trigger an ad request and impression increment on first visit to the page and any subsequent visits when last page visit was set to the expanded state. Visibility defaults to the full Billboard execution on first visit of the day, while setting a cookie with the current state, expiring at midnight. On revisit to the page, users will receive either the full Billboard or the unbranded show button, depending on the state they last selected. Show button exists within the HTML page content.
